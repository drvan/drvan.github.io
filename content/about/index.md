Hi! I'm Ryan - I'm a full stack developer and security solutions engineer with 8 years of experience solving 
challenging technical problems and building robust and innovative software. I currently work for Comcast as 
a Senior Principal Security Engineer. I also teach Reverse Engineering and Exploitation as part of the University 
of Delaware's Cybersecurity graduate program.

I enjoy learning new technology, being a parent to two awesome kids, and preparing for my first marathon. This site will host my notes as I journey through learning machine learning, natural language processing, and performing elaborate, yet harmless practical jokes on my closest friends.
