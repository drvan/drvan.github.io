I\u0026rsquo;m Ryan - I\u0026rsquo;m a full stack developer and security solutions engineer with 8 years of experience solving challenging technical problems and building robust and innovative software. I currently work for Comcast as a Senior Principal Security Engineer. I also teach Reverse Engineering and Exploitation as part of the University of Delaware\u0026rsquo;s Cybersecurity graduate program.\nI enjoy learning new technology, being a parent to two awesome kids, and preparing for my first marathon. This site will host my notes as I journey through learning machine learning, natural language processing, and performing elaborate, yet harmless practical jokes on my closest friends.
